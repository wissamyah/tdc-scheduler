## üéØ High-Priority Enhancements

### 1. **Member Attendance Tracking & History**
**Problem:** Currently, there's no way to track whether members actually participated in scheduled events.
**Solution:** Add an attendance tracking feature that lets leaders mark members as present/absent after events.

**Benefits:**
- Track member participation rates over time
- Identify inactive members who need follow-up
- Reward consistent participants
- Make data-driven decisions about member engagement

**Implementation:**
- Add `events` array to data structure with event history
- Create admin panel for marking attendance post-event
- Display attendance percentage on member cards
- Add filtering by attendance rate (e.g., "active", "occasional", "inactive")

**GitHub Compatible:** ‚úÖ (stores in data.json, no backend needed)

---

### 2. **Event Planning & RSVP System**
**Problem:** Members submit availability but there's no way to plan specific events and collect RSVPs.
**Solution:** Add an event creation system where leaders can schedule specific events and members can RSVP.

**Benefits:**
- Clear communication about upcoming events
- Accurate headcount before events start
- Ability to cancel/reschedule if insufficient RSVPs
- Historical record of planned events

**Features:**
- Leader creates event (date, time, type: raid/war/training)
- Members see upcoming events on dashboard
- One-click RSVP (Going / Maybe / Not Going)
- Real-time RSVP counter
- Automatic notifications for events matching member availability

**GitHub Compatible:** ‚úÖ (events stored in data.json)

---

### 3. **Role-Based Member Classifications**
**Problem:** Alliance has different types of members (leadership, veterans, new recruits) with no way to distinguish them.
**Solution:** Add member roles/tags for better organization.

- Separate tracking for recruits vs veterans
- Role-specific notifications and features
- Better team composition planning

**Roles:**
- Leader / Co-Leader
